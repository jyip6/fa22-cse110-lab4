1.It will print 3. Because the loop will execute three times.

2.It wiil print 150. Because last prices[i] is 300, we can get discountPrices equal to 150 after the for loop ends.

3.It will print 150. In the last loop of for loop, finalPrice will be assigned 150.

4.The function will return the array[50, 100 150] In the loop, finalPrice will be pushed into discounted list, and discounted will return after the loop.

5.It will print error. i will not be defined, because the variable declared as "let" can not be defined outside of the loop.

6.It will print error. discountPrice will not be defined, because the variable declared as "let" can not be defined outside of the loop.

7.It will print 150. Because finalPrice is in the scope of function, in line 14, finalPrice can be accessible within the function block.

8.Function will return array [50,100,150]. In the loop, finalPrice will be pushed into discounted list, and discounted will return after the loop.

9.It will print error. i will not be defined, because the variable declared as "let" can not be defined outside of the loop.

10.It will print 3. "length" is equal to the length of the "price" list.

11.The function will return the array[50, 100 150] In the loop, finalPrice will be pushed into discounted list, and discounted will return after the loop.

12.    
A. student.name  
B. student["Grad Year"]  
C. student.greeting()  
D. student["Favorite Teacher"].name  
E. student.courseLoad[0]  

13.  
A. 32. 2 is converted to a string '2', and be concatenated to become '32'.  
B. 1. '3' is convered to number 3, and be concatenated to become '32'.  
C. 3. null is convered to number 0.  
D. '3null'. null is converted to string, and be concatenated to become '3null'.  
E. 4. boolean true is convered to number 1, 3+1=4.  
F. 0. boolean false is convered to number 0, and null is convered to number 0. 0+0=0.  
G. '3undefined'.undefined is converted to string, and be concatenated to become '3undefined'.  
H. NaN. undefined is converted to NaN, cannot not be mathematically operated with 3.  

14.  
A.true. '2' is convered to number 2, and compared to 1, 2>1.  
B.false. Because in string comparison, they compare in letter-by-letter, first character '1' in '12' is smaller than '2'.  
C.true.'2' is convered to number 2, and compared to 2, 2==2.  
D.false. Because === is strict equality operator, 2 and '2' are different types.   
E.false. boolean true is convered to number 1, and compared to 2, 2 is not equal to 1.  
F.true. Boolean(2) is convered to true. true==true is true.  

15.  
== will make type conversion when it do comparison. Bnd === will not, so when two type variable do comparison, it will return false.  

17.  
[2,4,6]. Because function doSomething will iterate through the array and make double. And push result to newArr.
